For best quality and full effects use chrome, Firefox is ok but lacks some effects.

ISSUES:
- The safari version of the site has a hover/highlighting issue.
- In github the sound tends to act up or just doesnt work.
- Sometimes hovering acts a little twitchy.

If you have issues hearing the sounds here on [THE GITHUB VERSION](https://rawgithub.com/WaffleGnome/BattleFieldRemake/master/intro.html) of the site you can visit [THE DROPBOX VERSION](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/161826274/mySites/bf3REMAKE/intro.html).

TOOLS:
- For the Auto scrolling news bar i used [AutoScroller](http://www.yeesiang.com/jquery.autoScroller/).
- The hover clicking sound came from [Sound Bible](http://soundbible.com/). 
- The loading screen and buttons were made using [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) and [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/)
