BattleFieldRemake
=================
This site was made as an example for the codecademy group [Web Development Tutorials](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/html-projects).

Heres my example so far. For best quality and full effects use chrome, Firefox is ok. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:
- work on some bugs in safari 
- Tidy up my code 
- Organize my folders
- Fix the ipad version
- Adding more clickable pages( maybe even a playable mission? )

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUES:
- The safari version of the site has a hover/highlighting issue.
- Sometimes the sound in github doesnt work so you might not hear the background music or clicking sounds.

If you have issues hearing the sounds here on [THE GITHUB VERSION](https://rawgithub.com/WaffleGnome/BattleFieldRemake/master/intro.html) of the site you can visit [THE DROPBOX VERSION](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/161826274/mySites/bf3REMAKE/intro.html).

For the Auto scrolling news bar i used [AutoScroller](http://www.yeesiang.com/jquery.autoScroller/).
The hover clicking sound came from [Sound Bible](http://soundbible.com/).
