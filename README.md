BattleFieldRemake
=================
This site was made for the codecademy group [Web Development Tutorials](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/html-projects).

Heres my example so far. For best quality and full effects use chrome, Firefox is ok. I still need to work on some bugs in safari , tidy up my code and i plan on adding more clickable pages.

This site was made for educational purposes only.

For the Auto scrolling news bar i used [AutoScroller](http://www.yeesiang.com/jquery.autoScroller/).
The hover clicking sound came from [Sound Bible](http://soundbible.com/).
