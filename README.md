BattleFieldRemake
=================
This site was made for the codecademy group Web Development Tutorials.

Heres my example so far. For best quality and full effects use chrome, Firefox and iPad are ok too. I still need to work on some bugs in safari , tidy up my code and add more clickable pages.

This site is for educational purposes only.

For the Auto scrolling news bar i used [AutoScroller](http://www.yeesiang.com/jquery.autoScroller/).
The hover clicking sound came from [Sound Bible](http://soundbible.com/).
