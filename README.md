BattleFieldRemake
=================
This site was made for the codecademy group [Web Development Tutorials](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/html-projects).

Heres my example so far. For best quality and full effects use chrome, Firefox is ok.

TODO:
I still need to work on some bugs in safari , tidy up my code and i plan on adding more clickable pages.

Sometimes the sound in github doesnt work so you might not hear the background music or clicking sounds.

If you have issues hearing the sounds here on the github version of the site you can visit [THE DROPBOX VERSION](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/161826274/mySites/bf3REMAKE/intro.html).

For the Auto scrolling news bar i used [AutoScroller](http://www.yeesiang.com/jquery.autoScroller/).
The hover clicking sound came from [Sound Bible](http://soundbible.com/).
