The following site was made as an [challenge](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/html-projects/discussions/51e3305e9c4e9d6b630069a8) example for the codecademy group [Web Development Tutorials](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/html-projects) 

[MY CODE!!](https://github.com/WaffleGnome/BattleFieldRemake)

For best quality and full effects use chrome, Firefox is ok but lacks some effects. <br>

[THE GITHUB VERSION](https://rawgithub.com/WaffleGnome/BattleFieldRemake/master/intro.html) or  [THE DROPBOX VERSION](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/161826274/mySites/bf3REMAKE/intro.html) of the site.

TODO:
- Fix some bugs in safari 
- Tidy up [my code](https://github.com/WaffleGnome/BattleFieldRemake)
- Organize my folders
- Fix the ipad version
- Add a glitchy page transition effect
- Adding more clickable pages( maybe even a playable mission? )

ISSUES:
- The safari version of the site has a hover/highlighting problem.
- In github the sound tends to act up or just doesnt work.
- Sometimes hovering acts a little twitchy.

If you have issues hearing the sounds here on [THE GITHUB VERSION](https://rawgithub.com/WaffleGnome/BattleFieldRemake/master/intro.html) of the site you can visit [THE DROPBOX VERSION](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/161826274/mySites/bf3REMAKE/intro.html).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
TOOLS:
- The hover clicking sound came from [Sound Bible](http://soundbible.com/). 
- The loading screen and buttons were made using [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) and [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/)
